Need to figure out a way to install zookeeper independently of mesos

write scripts to install and configure the mesos master (includes mesos-master, zookeeper, marathon, chronos)
!! works with single master, 
!! Multi master sometimes goes into a strange situation where masters cannot establish leader
!! in those situations where leader is assigned, slave does not register with master, status updates are suspended 
	I1030 20:49:59.897480  2746 slave.cpp:705] New master detected at master@172.31.0.10:5050
	I1030 20:49:59.897699  2746 slave.cpp:730] No credentials provided. Attempting to register without authentication
	I1030 20:49:59.897754  2746 slave.cpp:741] Detecting new master
	I1030 20:49:59.897801  2746 status_update_manager.cpp:176] Pausing sending status updates

make it so vagrant destroy doesnt invoke the provisioning scripts
put a provisioner do block around the provisioning scripts
