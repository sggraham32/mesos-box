rethink the base box, just have it install java and the repos, 

DONT do the apt-get -y install crap, do that in the individual boxes
Need to figure out a way to install zookeeper independently of mesos

write scripts to install and configure the mesos master (includes mesos-master, zookeeper, marathon, chronos)
!! works with single master, something weird with multi master not finding the master


make it so vagrant destroy doesnt invoke the provisioning scripts
put a provisioner do block around the provisioning scripts
