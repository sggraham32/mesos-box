rethink the base box, just have it install java and the repos, 

DONT do the apt-get -y install crap, do that in the individual boxes
Need to figure out a way to install zookeeper independently of mesos

write scripts to install and configure the mesos master (includes mesos-master, zookeeper, marathon, chronos)
!! works with single master, something weird with multi master not finding the master

write scripts to install and configure mesos workers
!! slaves not connecting back to master for some reason
!! looks like none of the file based things are working, nor is the service crap.  @#$it invoke commands directly and export vars

make it so vagrant destroy doesnt invoke the provisioning scripts
put a provisioner do block around the provisioning scripts
